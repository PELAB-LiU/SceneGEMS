"""Gazebo simulation layer adapter: the generated ocean world, one SDF model per vessel and the Gazebo service.

The vessels of one world are all driven by ArduPilot (SITL in lockstep with each model's
ArduPilotPlugin, the world running on its own) or all by the custom controller (the world paused
and stepped by the gz-transport actuator, gz_transport_actuator.py). One world cannot do both, so
an instance that mixes the two control layers is rejected.
